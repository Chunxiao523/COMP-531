Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
I like the presentation which talks about databases. Because he explicitly explained the differences between relational databases and non-relaitonal databases, this is a quite hot topic and I am really interested in this topic. Also the three choices he give us are useful, these are all popular databases and it is good to make a comparsion between them.

which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
The topic whihc I learnt most from is web crawlers. From his presentation, I learnt a framework which is called Scrapy, using this framework, we can build a web crawling, he expalined this clearly and he provided an example code.

which talk did you like the best and why?
My favouriate talk is advertising, I like this talk is because it is very vivid. This is an interesting thing that happens in our daily life everyday. I am curious to know how they do this and he happened to explained these in his talk. He told us how this work and how to defense this.

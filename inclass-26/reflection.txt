-What did you hope to learn but did not?
I think we should have more detailed courses related to Javascript, as least some materials explaining how fileter, map, forEach work. They are fundemental and useful
-What did you really enjoy in this course, and how?
Working out the inclass assignments with the help of our sweet professor!
And use the knowledge in inclass assignments to project.This part is interesting, we learn things in inclass assignments and use them in the project
-What worked well in this course? and how?
The inclass assignments are really useful
-What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
TA sessions...Also I think you should give suggestions to windows user, install Ubuntu system, in this case, both of us can have an easier life.
I think you should give us more teaching materials, because at first I didn't have any experience in web development, I spent large amount of time on figuring out what virtual node is, what react and redux is doing etc... You don't need to explain them in detail in class, but I think you should provide us more materials
-What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of inclass exercise, goals of projects  and be specific please:
It is really helpful that you stay in the classroom and answer our questions.

-What I want to say?
I spent a really hard time to handle this course.I was really sufferred, I always worked until 2 o'clock just to finish the inclass exersice, but I think I am really luck to have your help, you are really patient and I really appreciate that. I have become more and more confident on this course and I think now I love web development so much. I will take this experience as a treasure in my life.
Thank you Scott.

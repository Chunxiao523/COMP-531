Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
The most polished and delivered presentation is about Backbone.js. I like this presentation because he have convinced me that this is a really useful framework, very easy to use even comparing with react.js. I am interested to try this framework. Also, his presentation and his slides are very clear and easy to understand.

which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
Among these topics, I learnt most from "user experience". I think when I am designing my web application, sometimes, I focused too much on functionality and I ignored the user experience design. I learnt a lot from this topic since she provided the analysis with details and good explanations. I know what is a good user experience design and how to improve user experience from her speech. Such as accessible, fast speed,and desirable.

which talk did you like the best and why?
The talk that I like best is about CSS Frameworks. He mentioned several css frameworks which include bootstrap, foundation, and semantic UI. I like this talk best because he mentioned one key idea that is mobile first design. I think I should think more about mobile structures first when I am designing the layout of my application, because this is really important and this is something that I didn't realized before.
